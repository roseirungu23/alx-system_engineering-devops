Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

    Duration:
        Start Time: January 21, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)
        End Time: January 21, 2024, 2:45 PM (UTC)

    Impact:
        The outage affected the user authentication service, leading to a complete unavailability of login functionality.
        Approximately 30% of users experienced disruption during the incident.

    Root Cause:
        The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing a disproportionate distribution of incoming traffic, overwhelming the authentication servers.

Timeline:

    Detection:
        Detected at January 21, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC) through an automated monitoring alert indicating a significant increase in failed authentication attempts.

    Actions Taken:
        Investigated backend authentication servers for potential issues.
        Assumed initial hypothesis of a database connection problem.
        Analyzed server logs for unusual activity.

    Misleading Paths:
        Initially assumed a database issue due to error patterns, leading to unnecessary database optimizations that did not address the core problem.

    Escalation:
        Incident escalated to the System Operations team as the issue seemed beyond the scope of the development team.

    Resolution:
        Identified misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
        Adjusted load balancer configurations to evenly distribute incoming traffic.
        Implemented rate limiting on authentication attempts to prevent similar incidents in the future.
        Verified the resolution by monitoring successful authentication attempts.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause Explanation:
        The load balancer was misconfigured to unevenly distribute traffic among authentication servers. This led to overloading a subset of servers, causing service degradation.

    Resolution Details:
        Adjusted load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic.
        Implemented rate limiting on authentication attempts to prevent overload.
        Conducted thorough testing to ensure the stability of the updated configuration.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements/Fixes:
        Regular audits of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
        Implementation of automated testing for load balancing setups.
        Enhanced monitoring to detect unusual spikes in traffic patterns.

    Tasks to Address the Issue:
        Conduct a post-incident review with the team to share lessons learned.
        Document load balancer configurations and regularly update them.
        Include load balancer configurations in the deployment pipeline for version control.
        Schedule periodic training sessions for operations and development teams on identifying and addressing load balancer issues.
